This is my Project number one for building a browser based game

Technologies Implemented: HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Intructions: Concentation is a game in which the player selects a facedown card which will show a value, 
if the player makes a match then the player has successfully made a pair. If the player finds all the pairs 
then the player wins the game
